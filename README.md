# Feature_Scaling_In_Regression

This is a great resource from Coursera (with modifications) where; 

- Multiple variables routines developed in the previous lab utilized
- Gradient Descent on a data set with multiple features run
- The impact of the *learning rate alpha* on gradient descent explored
- Performance of gradient descent by *feature scaling* using z-score normalization improved.
